# Deploying a Proxmox VM for Testing

### ðŸ¤“ The Scripts ðŸ¤“

`test-env/create-vm-template.sh` - used to create a VM template using the downloaded template image

`test-env/download-template.sh` - used to download the disk image of a previously configured Proxmox host that is ready for testing with Tailmox

`test-env/revert-test-vms.sh` - used to revert VMs being tested with
- I currently have three Proxmox VMs with Proxmox installed inside of each
- this script reverts each VM to a snapshot named "ready-for-testing" that was taken after dependencies are installed and the "tailmox" project was cloned into the VM, but right before the script has been run for the first time
- this allows testing `tailmox.sh` easily by reverting the VMs before the clustering processes and data have been created
